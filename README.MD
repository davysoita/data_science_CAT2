Question 2 What features from the student data would be most relevant for predicting enrollment and graduation success?
-By examining academic performance that consist of :High school GPA, standardized test scores ,previous course grades, attendance records
-Use of demographic Information: age, socioeconomic background and first-generation college student status
-Enrollment & Program Data Chosen major, course load, ie, either (full-time, part-time or online), financial aid status, distance from campus (commuter or resident)
-Engagement & Support that include participation in extracurricular activities, use of academic support services, student feedback surveys


Question 3 How can you protect the privacy of student data while still using it to develop predictive models? 
-Data Anonymization: Remove personally identifiable information (names, IDs).
-Encryption: Secure sensitive records during storage and transmission.
-Differential Privacy: Add noise to data to prevent individual identification.
-Access Control: Limit data access to authorized personnel only.
-Compliance with Regulations: Follow FERPA (U.S.), GDPR (EU), or other applicable data protection laws.


Question 4 How can you communicate the results of your model to educational institutions in a way that is actionable and informative?
-Communicating Results to Educational Institutions to make results actionable:

-Visual Dashboards: Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly to present trends in student performance.

-Model Insights: Show feature importance (e.g., "Students with GPA < 2.5 have a 60% higher dropout risk").

-Early Warning System: Develop alerts for at-risk students, allowing intervention programs.

-Policy Recommendations: Suggest data-driven strategies like additional tutoring, financial aid, or mentorship programs.
